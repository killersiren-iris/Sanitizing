        COVID-19
    </h1>
    <p>
        FDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from emerging infectious diseases, such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support continuity and response efforts to this pandemic.

As part of these efforts, FDA published three guidances to help meet the increased demand for hand sanitizers during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, entities that are not currently registered drug manufacturers can register as over-the-counter (OTC) drug manufacturers and make alcohol-based hand sanitizers, pharmacies and registered outsourcing facilities can compound certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and alcohol production firms can produce alcohol for making hand sanitizers provided they follow the conditions outlined in the FDA guidances for industry.Consumers are reminded to keep hand sanitizers out of the reach of children and, in case of ingestion, to get medical help or contact a Poison Control CenterExternal Link Disclaimer immediately. Very small amounts of hand sanitizer can be toxic, even lethal, to young children.Hand sanitizers that meet FDA‚Äôs OTC drug review conditions or that are manufactured under the conditions in FDA‚Äôs temporary policy will include a ‚ÄúDrug Facts‚Äù label similar to the ones found at the end of the guidance: Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19). Consumers should assure they are following the warnings and precautions described on this label, particularly regarding use in children. The Drug Facts label will also describe the ingredients in the product. Hand sanitizers are over-the-counter (OTC) drugs regulated by FDA.

        Advantages
    </h1>
    <p>
        Require less time than hand washing.
Act quickly to kill microorganisms on hands.
Reduce bacterial counts on hands.
Do not promote antimicrobial resistance.
Are less irritating to skin than soap and water.
Some can even improve condition of skin.One of the biggest benefits of using hand sanitizer over soap is that you don‚Äôt need to be near a sink. There are many instances where the need to rinse your hands is highly inconvenient. 
You might not be near running water or have to wait in long lines at a public restroom to get access to a sink. Hand sanitizer is similar to using lotion in that it requires no other resources or prep work in order to use it. You can never replace the use of hand sanitizer with hand soap while on the go. Soap isn‚Äôt portable and won‚Äôt remove any pathogens from your hands unless you have water to rinse them off.
Portability makes hand sanitizer a smart choice for protecting your hands from germs throughout the day. Keep a bottle handy in your pocket or briefcase to use after you come in contact with surfaces in public spaces.
Food trucks and other street food vendors won‚Äôt have a place for you to wash your hands before eating. Having your own hand sanitizer gives you the option to clean your hands before you eat. Hand sanitizer can be made at home to meet all your sensitive skin needs. Make homemade hand sanitizer using organic ingredients or with essential oils that match your favorite scent. 
The ingredients are easy to find in stores and won‚Äôt cost much to make. If you have a large family, you might actually save money by making your own hand sanitizer recipe for everyone in the household. 
The amount you invest in your formula is completely up to your budget and wellness needs. Bacteria won‚Äôt become resistant to the ingredients of hand sanitizer like they can with soap. Antibacterial soaps use an ingredient called Triclosan which has been suspected of worsening the strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria present on the hands.
There is no similar concerns with hand sanitizer. The active ingredient in hand sanitizers is alcohol.
Alcohol has been used for thousands of years as an antiseptic. It kills bacteria through a process called denaturation. This is just a way of saying alcohol can completely dissolve bacteria.

        Disadvantages
    </h1>
    <p>
        Most liquid hand sanitizers contain a large amount of ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Therefore, they should be stored out of your child‚Äôs reach and only used with adult supervision. If ingested, alcohol toxicity can even lead to alcohol poisoning. In fact, from 2011 to 2015, U.S. poison control centers received nearly 85,000 calls about alcohol-based hand sanitizer exposures among children (source).
Studies suggest that children may be more likely to swallow hand sanitizers that are scented, brightly colored, or attractively packaged (source). Older children and adults might even purposefully swallow hand sanitizers to become intoxicated. To avoid ingestion and poisoning, buy hand sanitizers with child-resistant caps, keep the sanitizers out of reach, or simply purchase effective, non-alcohol hand sanitizers from a company you trust. When used too frequently, alcohol-based hand sanitizers can wash away your skin‚Äôs natural oils, which can cause drying and cracking. Dehydrated skin can be unattractive and irritating, and it is likely to cause one or more of the following symptoms:
Itching,
Slight to severe flaking, scaling, or peeling,
Fine lines or cracks,
Gray, ashy skin color,
Redness,
Deep cracks that may bleed. Most hand sanitizers on the market contain a high volume of alcohol, enough to be considered a fire hazard. In fact, ‚Äúalcohol-based hand sanitizers are classified as Class I Flammable Liquid substances, which means they have a flashpoint of less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.‚Äù   </p>
